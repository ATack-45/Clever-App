#### JavaScript Functionality:

1.  **Session Validation on Login Click**:

    -   When the user clicks the login button, the script checks the validity of the current session by sending a request to the `/validate-session` endpoint.
    -   If the session is valid, the user is redirected to `/Dash`.
    -   If invalid, a modal for password entry is displayed.
2.  **Password Submission**:

    -   When the user submits the password, it is hashed using SHA-256.
    -   The hashed password is sent to the `/login` endpoint for validation.
    -   If successful, the user is redirected to the dashboard (`/Dash`).
    -   Errors are handled by displaying a message and preventing the login process if the password is incorrect.
3.  **Song Addition**:

    -   When the form to add a song is submitted, the song name and artist are collected from the input fields.
    -   The values are checked to ensure both fields are filled in.
    -   A POST request is sent to `/add-song` with the song and artist information to add the song to the queue.

#### Interaction Flow:

-   **Login Flow**: When the login button is clicked, session validation occurs, and if successful, the user is taken to the dashboard. If not, the password modal is shown.
-   **Song Queue Flow**: Users can add songs to the queue by entering song details into the form. Successful additions or errors are shown as messages below the form.
